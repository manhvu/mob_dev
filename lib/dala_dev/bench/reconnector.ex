defmodule DalaDev.Bench.Reconnector do
  @moduledoc """
  Auto-reconnect logic for the bench's BEAM dist connection.

  When a probe says the dist connection has dropped (`:alive_epmd_only` or
  `:alive_dist_only` after an RPC timeout), we want to attempt to reconnect
  automatically rather than leaving the bench in a stuck state for the rest
  of the run.

  This module is *pure logic* — no GenServer, no timers. The bench polling
  loop calls `tick/2` once per cycle, which decides whether to attempt a
  reconnect based on the current reachability and elapsed time since the
  last attempt. This keeps the reconnect logic testable and lets the
  caller control the cadence.

  ## Backoff schedule (defaults)

      1st attempt: immediate
      2nd attempt: 2 s after 1st
      3rd attempt: 4 s after 2nd
      4th attempt: 8 s after 3rd
      Subsequent: 30 s cap

  Reset to immediate on a successful reconnect.
